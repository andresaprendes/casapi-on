# Rounded Favicon Placeholder

This file should be replaced with an actual rounded favicon image.

To create a rounded favicon:
1. Take the existing logo.png
2. Apply rounded corners (typically 8-12px radius for 32x32 favicon)
3. Save as favicon-rounded.png
4. Update the HTML to reference this new file

The favicon should be 32x32 pixels or 16x16 pixels for optimal browser display.
